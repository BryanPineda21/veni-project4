## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

- A challenge while building this app is finding an API that has attributes and images all withing the JSON.
- Another challenge was figuring out the logic in order to ban and unban the attributes.
- Lastly, I did my best to make this web app look fun and fit the theme of cats.
- Overall, This was a challenge but I had fun learning and making this web app.
